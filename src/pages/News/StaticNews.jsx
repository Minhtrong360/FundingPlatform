            4. You need to identify the necessary assumptions to build a
            financial model and valuation for Solarpanel
          </h2>
          <p>
            For a financial model and valuation, the assumption dataset is the
            most important and is the backbone of the model. Accurate
            assumptions will help you build an accurate financial model and
            valuation. Assumptions that lack logic and are unrealistic will lead
            to a flawed financial model and cannot be applied in real business,
            production.
          </p>
          <p>
            This dataset includes metrics related to common metrics such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              General assumptions: Company name, Number of forecast years,
              Currency, Starting cash balance, Income tax rate, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assumptions about customers: Number of new customers per month,
              growth rate of new customers per month, churn rate, cost to
              acquire new customers, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Revenue-related assumptions: Sales channel, Distribution of
              customers from the sales channel into revenue calculation, Product
              name, Product price, Revenue discount, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cost-related assumptions: Cost name, Cost type, Cost value, Cost
              growth rate, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personnel-related assumptions: Position, Basic monthly salary,
              Annual salary increase rate, Number of personnel, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fixed asset-related assumptions: Name of the fixed asset to be
              purchased, Fixed asset value, Quantity of fixed assets to be
              purchased, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Borrowing-related assumptions: Loan name, Loan amount, Interest
              rate, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Capital raising-related assumptions: Name of the capital raising
              program or round, Percentage of equity offered, Form of capital
              raising, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With AI support, making these assumptions has become much quicker,
            easier, and more efficient.
